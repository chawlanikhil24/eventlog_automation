***NOTE: PLACE THE SHELL SCRIPTS i.e. "event_shell.sh" and "build_deb.sh" TOGETHER and execute "event_shell.sh"***



INTRODUCTION:
I was assigned a task in which i've to :

Create a command line tool that 
 * builds eventlog in a docker image
 * creates debian package
 * creates a minimal release draft on github
 


CONCLUSIONS:
 I've successfully accomplished all the above mentioned tasks. 
 


WORKING OF SHELL SCRIPT:
The attached shell script runs in root environment.
The required packages will get downloaded on their own and the building of eventlog will take place via "Dockerfile".
I've attached the "Dockerfile" in eventlog repository forked in my github i.e. "chawlanikhil24/eventlog"
After the successfull building of eventlog, now the shell script will execute the github drafting part.
For the excecution of release draft, there are 3 parameters:
  1) github <username>
  2) github <repository-name>
  3) github <token> #incase if you don't have the github token, then you can get one at; https://github.com/settings/tokens
After the input of above 3 parameters the job will be complete.
Then at last the shell script for building a debian package will execute and it also has a few PARAMETERS while executing.
  1) name
  2) email_id (abcd@xyz.com)

ALTLAST, I'd like to thank Mr. Budai Laszlo for his guidance throughout the assignment.

THANK YOU!
